        "Starlight twinkles bright\nGuiding stars within the night\nCosmic harmony",
        "River\'s voice so low\nEchoes of memories past\nWisdom in its flow",
        "Morning\'s dewy kiss\nAwakening world, new life starts\nRenewal unfurls",
        "Golden light descends\nPeaceful evening\'s gentle hush\nLove(\'s eternal bond,"
        "Misty mountain morn)\nFoggy veil, secrets untold\nEnchantment surrounds",
        "Garden\'s hidden depths\nSecrets hidden beneath the soil\nTreasures yet to find",
